3 +++ means fully complete

- Player movement+++
-- strafing: left, right, up, down
-- look direction
-- cursor movement
-- smooth camera follow
-- switch to rigidbody, character controller is doo-doo. Still translate though for move dir

- Player Animations+
-- move: forwards, backwards, left, right
-- idle

- Player stats++
-- health
-- speed/animation speed

- Weapons+++
-- name/id
-- firerate
-- ammo
-- reload speed
-- cost
-- damage
-- upgrades

- Weapon Switching+++
-- slowmo
-- hold up to 4 weapons

- Weapon Management+++
- keep track of equipped weapons
- keep track of owned/unowned weapons
- keep track of different types of weapons: rifles, pistols, launchers, specials

- Enemies++
-- look direction
-- speed (may increase...not sure, maybe just a little for some)
-- damage (increases every so waves, will have to pull data from file)
-- types
-- name/id
-- health (increases every so waves, will have to pull data from file)
-- abilities: jumping, clawing, biting, charging etc.... think of more..
-- Leaders....? but why though =(
-- pathfinding....fuck (solved, using Aron Granberg's Pathfinding Solution)

- Fortifications++
-- Buy weapons/foritifications
-- Upgrade weapons/fortifications
-- When weapon is bought, remove from buy screen. Place it in upgrade screen? Or place X through it to say its been bought?
-- To upgrade fortification, hover over it in game and click on it to bring up its individual upgrade attributes.
-- To equip new weapon have players current inventory displayed, click on weapon to equip and say "Yes" to equip? hmm...
-- Grid snapping for fortifications, tile based? most likely....  can only place objects on tiles, but tiles surround a good portion of the map
-- Fortification stats: health(how much damage it can take), damage(how much damage it can do when an enemy is hitting it), cost(how much it costs),
-- Simplify menu
-- Hover over barriers, display health and ammo left if any
-- Create a different turret that shoots lightning, emp blast or something...
-- Fix clipping of models when colliding with other barriers at corners
-- Redo display of main menu: Build, Weapons, Abilities, Begin Wave.  Weapons includes four fields: Rifle, Pistol, Launcher, Special, each listing weapons specific to that
   category.  Also add refill button to weapon currently equipped
-- Possibly simplify to only 3 upgrades for each fortification/weapon

- Audio Manager+
-- Sounds for footsteps
-- Gun sounds
-- Enemy sounds
-- Clicking noises
-- Breaking of barriers
-- Fire

- Spawn System+
-- Enemies spawn in only 15 allowed at once
-- Big enemies spawn smaller enemies around them
-- Random spawn points enemies can crawl out of for night enemies, when player gets close

- Day/Night System++
-- Begins during the day, slowly go to night...
-- How many waves till first dusk?...
-- How to make transition?...

- Win Condition++
-- Final build wave, start last wave
-- Enemies just keep coming...most likely during day
-- Rescue crew come and holster up ship...timer begins
-- After timer reaches 0, player wins, end game...

-- Lose Condition++
-- Player dies
-- If ship dies, player loses fortification abilities

- Game Considerations/Feedback
-- Building barriers needs to be fun for the player
-- Possibly have barriers placed at start of game to let the player know they are important
-- Make them cheaper to buy
-- Build during day, fight enemies at night?....cool idea, but not the direction we want
-- Need to define a solid aesthetic!!!
-- Make building barriers a priority....or that its a more probable strategy.
-- Enemies drop resources, player collects them, it equals a certain barrier...during build wave, player clicks what they want to build,
   and then the can click in rapid succession what they wanna build. Same goes for player weapons..I like this idea, but then again, not
   sure if itll work for this game.
-- Have ship at center of camera, but even though the ship is important, the game doesnt end because the ship gets destroyed. It ends when the player dies.
   Only the ship ignitiates the end game....
-- Must indicate to player early on in first part of game right as they start that the ship is what they are protecting.
-- Easier and simpler to place barriers, buy them and then keep placing them until player wants to switch fortifications.

- Things left to do...
-- Hook up final UI for build phase
-- Hook up new character model and final animations
-- Hook up magazine models/have them drop on the floor when reloading.
-- Bug fixes
-- XML updates
-- Hook up lightning turret
-- Fix lightning weapon
-- Hook up the rest of sound effects/music
